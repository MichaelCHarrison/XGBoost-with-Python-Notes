    "Gradient boosting involves creating and adding trees to the model sequentially. New trees are created to correct the residual errors in the predictions from the existing sequence of trees. The e畫ct is that the model can quickly fit, then overfit the training dataset. A technique to slow down the learning in the gradient boosting model is to apply a weighting factor for the corrections by new trees when added to the model. This weighting is called the shrinkage factor or the learning rate, depending on the literature or the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive gradient boosting is the same as gradient boosting with shrinkage where the shrinkage factor is set to 1.0. Setting values less than 1.0 has the e畫ct of making less corrections for each tree added to the model. This in turn results in more trees that must be added to the model. It is common to have small values in the range of 0.1 to 0.3, as well as values less than 0.1."
